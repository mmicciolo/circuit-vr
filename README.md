# circuit-vr
IMGD5000 Class Project
**Please read this entire readme before using.**
## Organization
The repository is organized into two main folders:
1. **public** - This consits of any files that can be modified publically. Assets, documentation, etc.
2. **private** - This consists of files that should never be modified manually (Unity C# Project)
## Using the repository
1. Either GIT cmd line can be used or more preferable git desktop.
2. Always pull before commiting
3. Only 1 person should be working with a specific file at a time in the public directory (can't merge binary files)
4. Anyone can work on anything in private (easy to merge source files in visual studio)
